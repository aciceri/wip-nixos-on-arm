WIP stuff for NixOS on ARM
==========================

Personal playground for some ARM targets.


Not a FAQ
---------

### So this is for the NixOS on ARM project?

No.

There is no *NixOS on ARM* "project".

*NixOS on ARM* is just NixOS, running on ARM.

It just happens that many ARM target requires careful cajoling, and this repo
is where I'll be putting some work into cajoling some of those targets.

Generally what this means is that the kernel config and system configs needed
to compose on top of stock NixOS will live in this here repository.
